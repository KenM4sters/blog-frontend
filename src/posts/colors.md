title: Why One Colour Is Prdouced Over Another
description: A short article that adresses something that perhaps you've questioned a few times before, but never got round to understanding - why objects appear as different colours.

Light is emitted when electrons release energy in the form of a photon of radiation in order to relieve themselves from being in an "excited" state. 

But why would an electron emit purple light instead of say,  red for example? 

Well, the only difference between red and purple, or between any colour in fact, is the wavelength and frequency of that radiation. 

And what I mean by "wavelength" is this:

Radiation, such as visible light, can be described as being a packet of energy that oscillates up and down throughout space-time as a wave. 

An a sort of unrelated but interesting note - the foundational principle of quantum theory is that every fundamental particle in the universe exhibits wave-like properties, and can actually be described as being waves themselves! 

The distance between each peak or troph is what we call the "wavelength" of that radiation, and how many waves it completes per second is its frequency. 

Hopefully, you'll be able to recognise that these 2 characteristics are inherently connected, as the longer the wavelength, the smaller the number of waves that it's going to be able to complete per second. 

What we generally refer to as "light", we should really be calling "visible light", as we can only see a very small range of wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum.

In reality, the entire spectrum of radiation is "light", but most of it we can't actually see with our own eyes, but that doesn't mean to say that some other mammals can't either...  So definitely get used to the idea that what you probably call "light", is really "visible light".

A photon of light is a wave of radiation that can come in a variety of different wavelengths.

In that sense, all forms of radiation (gamma, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, micro and radio), only differ from each other in terms of their wavelength and frequency, with gamma having the shortest wavelength and radio the longest.

Visible light is somewhere in between, and itself consists of another small range of wavelengths that themselves determine which particular colour is observed. 

Red has the longest wavelength, and purple has the shortest wavelength. Interestingly though, you might have guessed this if you think about a rainbow!

So that's the only difference between them - wavelength (and frequency)

But why would that be different? 

As in, why would red light be given off and not green, or radio instead of X-Ray?

Well, I've already covered that in the same article that I mentioned above, but I wanted to separately create this one to explicitly explain how colours are different from each other, besides the obvious!


Thanks for reading!
