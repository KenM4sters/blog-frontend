This is one of those things that probably most people have questioned at some point in their lives, but perhaps thought that the answer would simply be too complicated for them to understand. 

If you're one of those people, then I'm glad that you've found Expansive! 

We aim to inspire anyone and everyone to invest some time into trying to understand the world that we live in. 

The truth is - it's not too complicated for anyone, and I can assure you that by reading this short article in full, your understanding of the mechanisms behind the production of thunder and lighting will have at least multiplied by 10,000%.

It's time to finally understand the ins-and-outs, so without any further or do, lets get to the interesting stuff!


From the beginning

As you may have realised by now, thunder and lightning only occur during spells of warm weather, and are far more frequent in regions near the equator (the Caribbean, central Africa and Asia...) than in regions closer to the poles. 

The reason for this is because the phenomenon of a lightning strike begins with the evaporation of water at the surface of the Earth. 

The higher the temperature, the higher the amount of liquid water that evaporates into water vapour - similar to how you see steam come out of a kettle when the water gets hot enough ('Steam' is just a more common word for water vapour).

Lets just stop there for a moment and consider the following:

We know that kettles and saucepans need to get really hot for water to boil into steam, since the boiling point of water is around 100 degrees Celsius (depending on the purity of the water), but obviously oceans and lakes don't get anywhere near this hot?!

The confusion lies in the choice of wording. 

The two verbs "evaporate" and "boil" are often used interchangeably in informal conversations, but the reality is that boiling is defined as rapid evaporation. 

Water evaporates into water vapour (steam) really easily at surface pressure, but it needs to be around 100 degrees Celsius for it to rapidly evaporate. So don't get the two confused with each other!

Back to lightning though...

In truth, it doesn't take a lot of heat for liquid water to evaporate into water vapour, but it does take a lot of heat for enough water vapour to form to allow lightning strikes to occur.

So water at the surface, such as oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, rainwater etc evaporates into water vapour. 

The gaseous water vapour then rises up through the atmosphere (remember the common saying that "heat rises", although you can read more about why exactly that is here), where it begins to cool. 

The higher you go, the cooler it becomes, as the density of the atmosphere decreases with height from the surface (due to the air particles feeling a weaker gravitational attraction to the Earth's centre of mass + particles having less "weight" above them in terms of other particles the further up you go). 

Eventually, the water vapour will become cool enough to condense back to liquid water droplets. 

On especially warm days, the atmosphere is relatively unstable, as warm currents of air create turbulent regions of wind in the lower atmosphere where clouds form. 

These high winds will continue to drag the water droplets up and around through the atmosphere, stopping them from falling back down as liquid rain. As they get dragged higher and higher, they cool even more and freeze into ice particulates. 

These solid ice formations will be carried by turbulent winds and forced to cross paths with one another, breaking up into smaller parts as they collide with each other. 

If the winds die down, or if the ice particles become too heavy, then they'll drop down to the surface as "hailstones", which I'm sure you're probably familiar with.

However, if the wind continues to sustain these particles in the lower atmosphere, then they will continue to collide with each other, and while doing so, they'll be creating the conditions for an imminent lightning strike, but how?

Separating charges

Something that I haven't mentioned up until now is that when these particles of ice slam into each other, the frictional forces knock subatomic particles off from each other, called electrons. 

An understanding of atomic structure isn't really necessary, but just know that simply put, electrons are negatively charged bundles of energy that randomly orbit in different energy levels around a ball of positively charged energy. 

There's an unimaginable amount of these bundles of energy that exist within even a tiny particle of ice, and as they smash into each other, they knock some of these electrons off, creating regions of separated negative and positive charges. 

This concept is known as static electricity, and I'm sure you've probably heard of it before. 

A (hopefully) helpful analogy that we're all familiar with is this:

Have you ever wondered why, when you rub a balloon against your hair for long enough, they become attracted to one another, and if you hold the balloon close enough, your hair will spike up in the direction of the balloon?

Well, it's for the same reason as with the ice cubes - the friction between your hair and the fabric of the balloon causes electrons to be stripped away, creating regions of opposite charges. If the two regions come close enough together, they will feel a sufficient force of attraction for, in this case, your hair to stand up in the direction of the now oppositely charged balloon. 

Something more theoretical...

Now, unfortunately, we've hit a point where you might just have to accept some theory, for now at least... 

At this present moment in time, scientists aren't totally clear on why this is the case, but consider the following:

Generally speaking, the surface of the Earth is slightly negatively charged, but when a storm passes directly overhead, the two negative regions repel each other, which forces the negative charges at the surface to dissipate and move away, leaving regions of positive charges that feel an attractive force towards the negative regions. 

In this universe, something that you just have to accept is that opposite charges attract one another, and hence our positively charged particles at the surface are feeling an attraction towards the region of negative charges in the atmosphere, and visa-versa. 

This difference in charges between the lower atmosphere and the surface creates a potential difference, otherwise known as a Voltage. 

Usually, gases are extremely poor conductors of electricity, as particles of a gas constantly move around at high speeds, disallowing any kind of charge carrier like an electron to create a path through the substance. 

However, when the voltage is high enough, gases turn into plasma. 

You can read more about plasma here, as the specifics are a bit off-topic for this article, but suffice to say that plasma conducts electricity very well.  

When the difference in charge becomes high enough (ie enough ice particulates smash into each other to release a sufficient amount of electrons), the two regions feel an overwhelming force of electrostatic attraction to each other.

At this point, electrons and ions that carry negative charges rush down towards the positively charged regions at the surface in a zig-zag like fashion. 

We refer to these zig-zagging negative charges as step leaders, and from here it's a race of the first to neutralise with the positive charges at the surface. 

As a quick side note - you might be wondering why these charged ions move in a zig-zag like pattern, especially when we all know a straight line would be the shortest path!

You wouldn't be wrong in thinking so, but the trouble is that the "path", in this case, is an ever-changing, turbulent packet of air particles. 

Charged particles will always follow the path of least resistance, and in some cases, that might just involve changing direction a lot.

When one does eventually link up with the surface though, a circuit is completed, and the charges on both ends rush through this circuit to neutralise with each other. The movement of charges is what we call a current, and it's this current of energy that produces the lightning strike that we see. 

This flow of electricity is of an extremely high order of energy (1 gigajoule), heating the gases that are conducting this electricity to 30,000 degrees Celsius (54,000 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 5 times hotter than the surface of the Sun! 

To help put into perspective just how much energy that really is, 1 gigajoule is equal to 1,000,000 joules, and 2000 calories is roughly equal to a mere 8,300 joules. 

The conducting gases absorb some of this electrical energy, and the electrons of the atoms that make up these gases become "excited" (they're in a state of elevated energy). 

You can read more about how electrons end up releasing light here, but the short story is that electrons emit this energy as light that we can see, and atoms of different elements will release different colours of light.

Nitrogen makes up around 80% of our atmosphere, and the most common wavelength of light that it's electrons produce when they drop back from these excited states corresponds to a pale white-blue colour. 

Remember, colour is just our brains' way of differentiating between different electromagnetic waves, where purple is the most energetic and red is the least (of the light that we can see of course - gamma and X-ray are far more energetic than purple).

It's worth remembering though that other colours are also released, but our eyes/brains simulate a mash up of them all, so the one with the highest intensity is the one that will be most prominent to us. 

However, that's not everything....

Just like how the light from the Sun is scattered in our atmosphere to produce the colour blue, the light from lightning strikes also gets scattered as it travels through the atmosphere towards our eyes, but to varying degrees, based on a range of different factors. 

For example, water in the atmosphere tends to scatter purple light the most, meaning that when there's a high level of humidity, lightning strikes generally appear as a purple(ish) colour. 

Alternatively, when there's a high level of dust in the atmosphere, lightning can appear more yellow(ish).

And so on...

So that's lightning, but what about thunder?

Don't worry, this one is much easier to understand. 

When the gases are heated to 30,000 degrees Celsius, they rapidly expand outward as they absorb huge amounts of the electrical energy, which gets converted into kinetic energy (the energy used for movement). 

The gas particles bump into each other, which then bump into their adjacent particles, creating this domino effect that we call a sound wave. 

This sound wave has a very high amplitude, as a result of the extreme temperatures involved, which corresponds to a very loud "clap" of thunder.

And..... that's pretty much everything.

Just to finish up, it might be useful to know that light travels far quicker than sound, which means that we see the lightning before we hear the thunder, and the difference will depend on how far away the storm is. 

Sound still travels very quickly though, but it changes depending on the temperature and pressure of the particles involved. 

At sea level and 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), sound travels through air at around 761 mph which, while impressive, is nothing compared to light which travels at 186,000 miles per second through an empty vacuum - that's 669,600,000mph!

Trying to imagine 670 million miles per hour is pretty difficult though, so perhaps try this instead:

A single photon of light can circumnavigate the entire Earth at the equator 7.5 times in a single... second...
