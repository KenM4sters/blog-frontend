The start of a domino effect

Sound waves are what we describe as the motion of particles colliding together. 

I know that might seem a bit confusing at first, so let's look at an example so that you can better formulate a picture of it in your head.

Say you decide to stomp your feet on the floor. 

When your foot makes contact with the floor, your displacing the air particles that were once there, in other words, you're forcing them to move out of the way.

The quicker you move your foot, the less time the particles have to move out of the way, hence they move with a greater velocity (because you're transferring more momentum - we'l talk more about that in a minute).

When they move out of the way, they inevitably collide with the air particles that were just outside of the area that you stomped your foot onto (their adjacent particles). This transfers momentum to those particles, just like how it would if they were a bunch of marbles or people etc...

This transfer of momentum increases the velocity of those air particles, which then bump into their adjacent particles and so on.... It's a domino effect of gas particles bumping into each other! 

However, with every transfer of momentum, a bit of energy is lost in a variety of different forms, such as heat.

Picture of a "Sonic Boom", which happens when objects travel faster than the speed of sound. You can read more about that here!






Turning down the volume

When 1 gas particle bumps into another, it doesn't transfer 100% of its momentum, and some energy is lost to forms like heat energy.  This means that the particle doesn't achieve exactly the same velocity as the previous one, and this continues decreasing to the point where the particles no longer move at all. 

At this point, the sound can no longer be heard....

See, that is all a sound wave is...

When you hear a sound, all that's happening is that you're within the distance of a collision such that the domino effect of colliding air particles reaches your ear drum. Your brain then analyses the velocity of the colliding air particles to produce a sound of X frequency and Y amplitude. 

Frequency (pitch) vs Amplitude (volume)

As you're probably aware, the frequency can change from molecule to molecule, as hitting a piece of wood sounds a lot different from hitting a piece of metal with the same amount of force. 

However amplitude is quite different...

This domino effect is what we call a sound wave, and the amplitude of that sound wave (ie the "loudness or volume") is determined by the distance over which the particles collide. 

If the particles had a lot of velocity from a collision that happened very quickly, for example from rapidly stomping your feet, then the particles will move over a greater distance, as they have more momentum than if it was a more delicate collision, say for example you just slowly tapped your feet. 

The momentum that you transfer to those gas particles to move out of the way will depend on how much momentum you have, and the momentum of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its velocity.

I feel like this one's pretty straight forward to understand, as if you imagine a bus hitting a wall at the same speed as a car, you can quite easily imagine how the bus would cause more damage (ie it would transfer more momentum to the wall) than a car, and if a car was travelling at a higher speed than another car of the same mass, it too would transfer more momentum.... 

Hence, momentum is proportional to both mass and velocity. 

Taking this back to sound waves though, if you jumped up in the air and then hit the floor, you would transfer more momentum to those gas particles under your feet than if you just raised your ankles or something, because you've given your body more velocity and hence more momentum. 

The effect of this is that the more momentum is transferred to the particles that your feet collide with, so they move over a greater distance, which correlates to a louder sound. 

So what about frequency?

Well as I mentioned earlier, that's a different story all together, in that it's dependant on the particles that are moving. 

Scientifically, the frequency of a sound wave is the rate at which the particles are colliding, which will depend on a few different factors, one of which is how close the particles are together, or how densely packed they are. 

This factor is what causes different sounds to be produced from different types of material, as particles are arranged differently depending on all kinds of different chemical factors which we won't go into detail of here. 

Suffice to say however, that the particles that make up a can of tin are arranged differently to those of a piece of plastic, and hence if you give them momentum by smacking them with your hand or a stick etc, the momentum that you transfer will (generally speaking) be the same, and hence they will produce a similar amplitude (loudness), but the amount of particles that collide in any given time will be completely different (which denotes the frequency, commonly referred to as the "pitch" of a sound)

And that's pretty much everything that you need to know! 

Hopefully that was clear enough to understand, but I'd advise reading through this one as many times as you feel you need to. It's a difficult concept to wrap your head around, but one that's definitely worth being comfortable with. 

If you're interested in knowing the reasoning behind the production of different famous(?) sounds like the sound of thunder, or a Sonic Boom, then a thorough understanding of this article will absolutely help you.
