**Online Astronomy/Physics Blog - Typescript (Svelte)**

Wanting to create an online blog as an outlet for the countless hours of time spent researching about the universe since I was a child was what embarked me on my computer programming journey in the first place. Originally, I made the website using a mainstream website editor, but found that I wasn’t able to produce something that I was entirely happy with, and so my journey in HTML, CSS and Javascript began. 

The online blog that you can see today is more of a homage to my beginnings as a software developer than anything else. I have almost 100 articles, all of which have been carefully thought out and produced by myself, and I feel like they deserve a home somewhere. Therefore, I decided to try out the latest Javascript framework that I had been hearing rave reviews about, Svelte, and went for the option to use Typescript, since I find from my experience in C that statically typed languages save me a lot of time chasing down compiler errors at compile time. 

Ultimately, my interests lie much closer to computer architecture than what a high-level language like Javascript/Typescript can offer me. Discovering pointers and memory management in C for the first time was a breath of fresh air for me and ever since I’ve never been so keen to develop my skills further.  

Writing all those articles took a significant amount of my time, more so since I made an effort to write them in a (hopefully) more engaging way, time which I feel if continued, would be much more worthwhile spent with Rust, C/C++ or Assembly. Therefore, at this moment in time, I have no plans in developing this project any further.

Transferring the text to markdown files for use in this project destroyed the formatting, and I haven’t yet taken the time to go through all the articles one by one and reformat them, so I apologise if they look like plain old html with no css…
