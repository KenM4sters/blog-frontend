Perhaps the most mysterious bodies in our entire universe, the existence of black holes was largely theoretical only until recently, with the first ever capture of the supermassive black hole that lies at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way. 

In fact, the famous Albert Einstein, whom you've most definitely heard of, predicted their existence with his theory of general relativity, which was largely considered to be scrap by most of his peers at the time. 

These days, however, the integrity of Einstein's work has been tested time after time, and been met with absolute success. 

If you're interested in learning about the particular proofs of his work, then I'd recommend checking out this article here, which investigates the notion of space-time curving due to mass, exactly how Einstein proposed it to. 

Make no mistake, what lies at the centre of a black hole is completely unknown, and will likely remain so as we seem unable to peer behind the event horizon (which we'll elaborate more on in a minute). 

You might have heard that at the centre of black hole lies a point that's infinitely dense, known as a singularity.

However, just like Schrödinger's cat, the concept of a singularity is more of mockery to our current model of the universe - a point of infinite density just doesn't make any sense... 

Since we've already mentioned two key "parts" of a black hole, let's take a closer look at how exactly black holes even come into existence. 

Formation of black holes

A black hole can be formed from the death of a massive star, far beyond the mass of our own star, the Sun, although it's worth baring in mind that this isn't the only way they can be formed. 

It's currently believed that a star would have to be of at least 3-10 solar masses, with 1 solar mass being the entire mass of the Sun, meaning that, in order for a black hole to remain as a stellar remanent at the time of the star's "death". 

But what do I mean by the "death of a star" ? 

Well, throughout a star's lifetime, it's in a constant turmoil of the forces that govern the universe: gravity, and essentially the energy produced form fusing atomic nuclei together. 

I go more into depth of the life-cycle of stars in a different article which, again, feel free to check out here , so we'll summarise by saying that when a large enough star runs out of fuel, gravity begins to crush the star.

As the core becomes denser, electrons and protons are eventually forced together to produce a body exclusively made form neutrons (a neutron star), which collapses further into matter that is, at the of writing this, unknown. 

When the collapse halts due to the outward pressure of [some form of matter], the surrounded gases explode outward across the cosmos, an event we call a supernova/hypernova (depending on its intensity). 

It's beyond difficult to image the scale of compression that we're talking about here, but a simple illustration would be to visualise the entire Earth being compressed down into the size of a sugar cube...

Which obviously sounds completely absurd, particularly so without knowing just how empty atoms really are.

Again, I do have a separate article that's specifically dedicated to explaining how everything that you can see around you is over 99.9% nothing (a mathematical breakdown is included, although it does assume so experimental values of the dimensions of protons, so I probably wouldn't call it a "proof" , per say... ), which you can check out here. 

Briefly though, the relative space between nuclei and orbiting electrons is huge - take note of the word relative here, since obviously we're talking about tiny volumes. 

If the proton at the centre of a hydrogen atom were the size of a cricket ball, then the atom as a whole would be the size of Earth, with one electron that occupies zero volume between that space... so nothing!

The significance of this is that all the matter that you can see and interact with around you, including yourself, is over 99.9% nothing... a mere empty vacuum in space. 

But what's the big deal with a black hole? 

Well, because their electrons have been forced to neutralise with protons to form a body that's exclusively made form neutrons with little to no empty space between them, they can be said to be over 99.9% mass-energy!

But let's test this numerically so we can a better idea of the scale of this.

I said that hydrogen atom was over 99.9% empty space, but the actual number would 99.9999999996%. 

Seeing as hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and the numbers vary insignificantly from atom to atom anyway, it seems appropriate to use the hydrogen atom as an example for this comparison.

Imagine a block of iron with mass 1kg. 

That iron block is 99.9999999996% empty space.

Now imagine that all that space is now filled with mass, just like the structure of a neutron star and black hole.

We would take our 1kg and now divide it by 0.0000000004 to calculate how much our new block of the same volume would weigh. 

1/0.0000000004 	= 2500000000
				= 2.5*10⁹
				= 2.5 billion kg

....

The trouble is though, even that doesn't do the density of a black hole justice...

This comparison is more appropriate for the density of a neutron star, since it's atomically structured in a way that's essentially being replicated in the previous thought experiment. 

Black holes, however, are somehow even denser...

In fact, to elaborate on a point I made earlier, black holes are supposedly infinitely dense!

Okay, that just can't be true.... but that's what classical mechanics tells us.

See, the reason why theories like relativity and QM (Quantum Mechanics) exist in the first place is to essentially fill in the gaps of classical physics, such as Newtonian mechanics. 

Einstein wasn't satisfied that gravity was a force, so he proposed the concept of space-time curving due to mass, which is what causes particles within this curvature to accelerate towards the object. 

Classical mechanics tells us that electrons would eventually fall into their relative nuclei as they constantly radiate energy and reduce their orbital radius as a result, which obviously can't be right either... so quantum mechanics says that electrons aren't classical particles, they're quantum particles (or waves) that obey completely different rules.

Why am I mentioning any of this?

The point is, we have several models of how the universe operates, but not a single complete one, although quantum mechanics is the most promising at the time of writing this, as it explains 3 of the 4 fundamental forces in the universe:
* Strong nuclear force
* Weak nucelar force
* Electromagnetism (coulomb force)
But not:
* Gravity 
Apologies that this is getting a little bit off topic now, but I promise it's all worth it!

Classical mechanics tells us that the density of a black hole is infinite, which we know simply cannot be true, and besides, all known models of physics break down at the singularity (we'll elaborate on that in a minute ) anyway, so it makes no sense to use classical mechanics when it breaks down - obviously the results are going to be non-sensical. 

But let's just break this albeit inaccurate concept down so we can understand just what an infinitely dense region of space means.

We know that black holes can have different mass, along with charge and angular momentum.

In fact, just as a quick side note here, those 3 characteristics are the only way pieces of information that we have about black holes - everything else (lepton number, baryonic number etc... is lost behind the event horizon, which we're about to come onto). 

Interestingly, this is where quantum mechanics fails at explaining black holes, since the concept of information always being preserved is a precursor to quantum mechanics, but we won't get into detail of that here. 

So if black holes can have different mass values and the concept of infinite mass is as ludicrous as any, and density is defined as being the amount of mass per volume, then we know that the volume must be the cause of this infinitely high density paradox. 

And how we do we get to infinity?

Mathematically, by diving by zero.

How many zeros go into 1?

If you cut a slice of cake with zero volume, how many slices could you cut?

You get the idea...

If the volume is zero, then no matter what value the mass is, the density will always be infinite, since any number divided by zero is infinity.

To make a slight comparison here, we know that electrons themselves essentially have no volume, but that's remarkably from saying that they have zero volume, despite them seeming interchangeable.

Electrons are point particles, meaning that do not occupy space in 3 dimensions, and since the volume of a particle involves measuring its area over 3 dimensional space, electrons cannot have volume. 
I explain why exactly they don't occupy 3 dimensions in this article here.

But the volume of an electron isn't zero, it just doesn't make any sense to describe them in that way.

The reason why I bring this up to differentiate between particles have zero volume, and no volume at all.

In contrast to electrons, singularities supposedly still have volume, just the value of which is zero which is what leads to an infinite density.

^An important distinction to remember

Besides making no sense intuitively, the concept of a singularity does also present some other issues, particularly when we account other pieces of information, such as angular momentum.

When stars collapse into black holes, angular momentum is conserved, meaning that black holes rotate incredibly quickly - usually at relativistic speeds (a significant % of the speed of light). 

This conservation of angular momentum means that the singularities must have spin, which would give them a ring-shaped structure - a so called ringularity, which contradicts the idea of zero volume. 

Theoretically speaking, a static, non-rotating black hole with no charge or angular momentum, dubbed a Schwarzschild black hole could exist, although in reality it would next to impossible since if even just a single photon of light collided with the singularity, it would cause it to spin slightly. 

The conclusion from all this?

Singularities/ringularities are concepts that arise from mathematics essentially misbehaving. 

They're non-sensical conclusions drawn from using our current models in situations that we don't yet fully understand. 

As we move on beyond the singularity of a black hole, I just want to clarify something here to make sure there's no confusion around which part of the black hole we're talking about.

When you see 3D computer-simulated images of black holes, you might be inclined to think that the region of blackness is the black hole.

However, that region of space that appears black isn't actually the black hole itself, and instead is the region of space around the singularity where the "force" of gravity is so high that even light cannot escape. 

On Earth, the escape velocity is around 11 km/s, meaning that you have to be travelling at least this fast in order to escape the overwhelming attracting to the Earth's centre of mass. 

If you're travelling slower than 11 km/s, then your acceleration due to Earth's gravity will eventually bring you back down to the surface. 

For a singularity, there's a region of space around this singularity where the escape velocity is higher than the speed of light, meaning that light can never escape.

In the absence of being able to see that light (because it can't reach our eyes) we see a supposedly empty void of blackness. 

Since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, as laid out by Einstein's theory of special relativity, anything that enters this region of space can never get back out, meaning that we cannot and probably will not ever be able to know for sure what's inside of this region.

Since the "force" of gravity decrease with distance form the object, the border where the scape velocity drops below the speed of light is what we call the event horizon.

Once something passes the event horizon, it cannot return.

Ultimately, since information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, we'll never be able to see beyond the event horizon and take a glimpse at the singularity itself.

So we've covered the singularity, the region of space where no light can elapse and the event horizon, so let's move on past the black hole itself and talk about some other features before finishing up with the biggest bomb-shell of all - time dilation....

First of all, black holes come in a huge range of masses and sizes. 

Most black holes are very dormant, remanent of massive stars that measure mere kilometers in diameter.

These black holes roam galaxies mostly minding their own business as they traverse through the emptiness of space. 

Other black holes however, exist at the centre of galaxies themselves, and are responsible (along with the attractive force of dark matter) for the formation of galaxies themselves. 

These black holes are categorised by their inconceivably high masses, and we refer to them as either supermassive or ultramassive black holes, depending on just how massive they really are.

These black holes are billions of time more massive than the Sun, and have a gravitational field strength that often causes nearby stars to complete shredded down or "spaghetiffied" as physicists like to say.

The matter is then forced into a very close orbit around the black hole travelling at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second!

Tidal and frictional forces superheat these gases, resulting in an intense glow that surrounds the black hole, and we call this disc of glowing gases the accretion disk of the black hole. 

Interestingly, when there's enough gas present in this accretion disk, high energy gamma rays can be ejected from the poles of the black hole, at which point we refer to the black hole as a quasar, although you can read more about them here. 

Not all black holes have an accretion disk though, as it requires matter to be present close enough to the black hole in the first place. 

At this point, we've covered the structure of a black hole, but let's now elaborate on a term I mentioned earlier - spaghetiffication. 

Spagettifaciton is the event of an object being completely stretched due to the tidal forces of a black hole, and happens when an object ventures too close. 

To avoid this article becoming too long, I'd recommend giving this article a read if you're unfamiliar with tidal forces, although as always, I'll give a brief explanation below:

For sake of ease, consider the Moon and the Earth.

The Earth pulls at the Moon with some gravitational "force" and visa versa, but because the Moon has volume, one side of the Moon is technically closer to the Earth than the other side and therefore experiences a stronger "force" of acceleration towards the Earth. 

Therefore, the Moon bulges, or stretches slightly as matter is being non uniformly accelerated. 

But the Earth's gravity isn't that strong, so the difference in force is fairly minimal.

A black hole however, can have a gradational field far, far stronger, causing objects to not just budge, but be completely pulled apart into a string of atoms... hence the name.

I talk about the relationship between gravity and density in a different article which you can check out here, so I'd recommend giving it a read if what I'm about to say doesn't make much sense to you.

Even-though the mass of a black hole can be less than that of a reasonably massive star (about 4 solar masses), the tidal forces experienced by objects within close proximity to a black hole can be devastating - sphagetifingly devastating.

The reason for this is because all of the mass of a black hole exists within such a tiny space, and since gravity essentially derives form an objects centre of mass, objects can literally get within a few kilometers of a black hole's centre of mass (the singularity, since almost all of the mass is held in the singularity, if you remember form earlier).

Because the force of gravity felt between two particles decreases exponentially with distance between them, the "force" that an object would feel only a few kilometers away from an object with more mass than 3 Suns would be astronomically high, which is what results in the incredible tidal forces. 

This is one of the biggest problems humanity will face in attempting to get satellites close to a black hole - tidal forces will strip them apart long before they get anywhere near close to the event horizon. 

Although as we mentioned earlier, sending any satellite past the event horizon wouldn't do much good anyway, since it would no longer be able to community with anything outside of the black hole...

With tidal forces covered, I think it's best if follow-through on that promise I made earlier of explaining what's probably the most fascinating concept associated with black holes - time dilation. 

We've seen it in movies like Interstellar, but does it really exist?

How can time literally run differently for people close enough to a black hole?

Don't worry, we'll cover all of that good stuff right now. 

I think it's best to begin with defining what time actually is, because I think a lot of the confusing around time dilation essentially stems from people having different "opinions" of time.

I know that sounds insane, but in essence, time is merely a measurement of change in events.

Time is how we measure changes across the universe, whether that be chemical reactions in our bodies, water flowing down a river, cars driving by, the Sun setting, seasons or whatever...

Think about it - if everything in the universe was static, how would we measure time?

It just wouldn't exist, right? 

How would you be able to separate the past, present and future from each other when everything is completely the same across all 3 time periods?

Well, you wouldn't. 

That's the true meaning of time, but the your pre-existing idea of time is that it's some clock that ticks at a certain frequency, then your right - time is non-changeable, and isn't affected from relativity, which we'll talk about in minute. 

So when we talk of time dilation, weren't talking about the rate of change in events becoming variable depending on:
* Where in the universe you're observing from and/or;
* How fast your travelling
To elaborate on a subject I brought up a moment ago - relativity - the whole concept of time dilation arises from one of the two postulates (a fancy word for hypotheses) made in Einstein's theory of special relativity. 

I'll list them both below because why not, but it's the 2nd one that's of interest to us here:
* Physics is the same in the universe, no matter where you are
* The speed of light (c) is constant.
To help us understand the significance of the second postulate, specifically on time dilation, consider the following thought experiment.

Image in your on the high-way travelling at 70mph (the exact speed isn't relevant).

You know you're moving very quickly because you can see perhaps the trees or road signs, which you known are stationary objects, move by incredibly quickly. 

Now let's say a car to your right is driving at the exact same speed as you.

If you focus on the person driving the car, and not the tyres (because the spinning tyres would indicate speed), then you would essentially have no idea that either one of you are moving. 

That's because velocity, just like everything other physical quantity is described as being relativistic by Einstein's theory of relativity, although in my opinion it's more than just a theory a this point...

Any object in the universe only has physical quantities because of its relationship with other objects... 

Now, this article is about black holes, and we can spend all day and night here talking about relativity, so I want to quickly make the connection this has to time dilation without wasting too much time, but I will just say that this idea of relativistic quantities goes all the way back to Ancient Greece, albeit in a much a simpler format. 

But relativity really transcends human observation and is more of an underlying foundation of what I would call experience itself. 

Perhaps you could use the word interchangeably with "reality" or "existence", but I just want to solidify the idea that it's functional in all scenarios in the universe. 

I mean how do you define feelings of emotion?

How do you define happiness?

Surely being happy is just not being sad, in that if you were happy all time, surely you would no longer be happy?

Even emotions themselves are relativistic - you only feel any of them BECAUSE of their relationship with the other emotions.

You can only be happy if you've been sad, you could only be hungry if you've not been hungry. 

By themselves, they simply don't exist. 

To summarise relativity in one sentence, there is no " an object is...", only "an object is [less than/greater than]...."

Moving swiftly back to time dilation though...

Another concept I could spend a while talking about is how we've proven time dilation to be true, but I think it would be best if I went over that in a separate article so that anyone who is here purely for black holes doesn't lose their mind!

So consider singing up to be notified when I drop that article!

So for now, let's just accept that significant time dilation exist when you're travelling either very close to a black hole or near the speed of light. 

As I just mentioned, I'm going to swerve the proof for time dilation travelling near the speed of light, but we will talk about time dilation near a black hole since that's obviously very relevant to this article. 

Time dilation occurs near a black hole due to how the black hole's gravity, or more specifically the curvature of space-time around a black hole, affects light. 


Just like the expansion of the universe can cause light to be stretched, or "redshifted" as it's commonly referred to as, simply because stretching a visible light wave gets it to or closer to the wavelength of the colour red, light can be stretched by the curvature of space-time due to mass.

At and beyond the event horizon, which hopefully you remember from earlier, photons of light infinitely redshifted as they travel faster enough to escape the black hole. 

Just outside of the black hole, however, light is redshifted enough to cause a physical delay to an observer far away from the black hole.

I think this is a good place to stop and clarify something so we're all on the same page.

Let's say there are two people, one of whom is approaching a black hole, and the other is observing far away from say for example,  a planet orbiting the black hole. 

Time NEVER changes for the person approaching the black hole.

That's not what time dilation says - only time appears to be running differently for that person, FROM the perspective of the person on the planet. 

The reason for this is because the light coming form the person approaching the black hole is getting redshifted and delayed by the black holes's gravity, which makes it seem as if time is running differently for them from the perspective of the person watching from the planet. 

In this example, we can establish two different units of time:

* coordinate time and;
* proper time
Coordinate time is the time that's felt by the person observing from the planet, and is variable due to effects on the speed of light, as we just mentioned.

Proper time, however, is the time that's experienced by the person approaching the black hole themselves, and is invariable - it NEVER changes. Time appears to be running exactly the same for the person approaching the black hole because he's not witnessing his own light being redshifted.

Don't worry, if you're struggling to understand the situation with light being redshifted, consider this quick thought experiment. 

The person near the black hole is reflecting photons of light.

Those photons of light are being pulled back towards the black hole with so much "force" that they take a considerable amount of time (depending on how close to the black hole you are) to reach the person observing from the planet. 

By the time they do reach the person observing, many minutes/hours.. etc may have passed for the person near the black hole. 

The person observing is receiving delayed information from the person near the black hole, which makes it SEEM as if time is running differently. 

The closer the approacher gets to the black hole, the longer light takes to reach the observer, until they cross the event horizon and the light is lost forever. 

You're never able to see them cross the event horizon - they simply freeze at the point of entry since no light beyond that point can get to you. 

Hopefully that clarifies things a bit more!

See, time only APPEARS to be running differently because the observer is receiving delayed light, and as we established earlier that time is a measure of change in events, and we can only measure changes by or less than the speed of light, because no information can travel any faster, time appears to change. 

However, nothing is actually happening for the person near the black hole - that's an important part to remember. 

The reason for this is because of the second postulate made by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which talked about earlier - the fact that the speed of light (s) is always constant for a local observer. 

It's all relativistic...

With the explanation out of the way with, let's get to the part while probably all most interested in - we've established that coordinate time changes, but by how much does it change?

Well, there is a formula for it which you'll see below.

    

Where,

* t = coordinate time
* 𝜏 = proper time
* r𝗌 = Schwarzschild radius of the black hole
* r = distance from the black hole

Remember that coordinate time is the time felt by the observer, while proper time is the time felt by the approacher. 

The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is simply the radius of the sphere that's black, since it's defined as being the region of space around the singularity where the scape velocity is greater than the speed of light. 

Escape velocity has it's own formula, but it's easier if we consider changes in time with changes in distance from the black hole where the distance measured is in multiples of the Schwarzschild radius, since black holes with different Schwarzschild radii will dilate time differently.

Take a look a the chart below to see time dilation in action.

As you can see, relativistic effects on the coordinate time are relatively small even when objects approaching what would still be very close to a black hole - the Schwarzschild radius of the average black hole would be around 10km or so, meaning that you were around 100km away from the average black hole, you would only experience just over an hour of time dilation.

This is quite simply because of the speed of light is inconceivably high (300 million m/s), so it takes a huge gravitational "force" to slow it down enough for to give significant impressions of time dilations for a far away observer. 

What's also interesting though is that, as you can see form the later values, the difference in proper time and coordinate time increases exponentially the closer you get to the black hole. 

The reason for this is because the force of gravity is exponentially related to time, meaning that if you halve the distance between two objects, you don't just double the force of gravity, rather you quadruple it.

This is accounted for by classical mechanics in Isaac Newton's famous universal law of gravitation. 

While being 1.00005rₛ away from a black hole would definitely be completely unrealistic due to the tidal forces that would be experienced at that proximity to the black hole (remember from earlier about spaghettification), it's interesting to see just how rapidly time coordinate can slow down for a far away observer. 

Again, this is because as light gets closer to the black hole, the amount of "pull" towards the black hole that it feels increases exponentially, resulting in it taking exponentially longer to reach a far away observing.

Because the observer is receiving light that's being delayed, time appears to run differently for him since our whole perception of time is based around seeing the changes in events around us.

So that's time dilation...

The point of this section was not only to clarify what time actually is, and how we define it, but also to bring light to how relativity plays a role in every aspect of our lives, not just in the observations that we make.

Sure, time is relative because time is defined as being changes in events, and we observe changes in events by processing the light that's coming from them. So if the time that light takes to an observer is changes, then so will the coordinate time that's experienced by that observer. 

But relativity is more than that.

I think it's neat to have relativity sit in the back of your mind throughout life, since I find it helps you appreciate the actual value of experience on planet Earth.

You can only ever have the good times because you have the bad times, so just remember that when you're in an uncomfortable position - it's the duality of the world that we live in. 

Every physical quantity only exists through its relationship with other physical quantities, and how you wish to define "physical quantity" is your prerogative. 

So now let's take a step back rom everything and asses what we have and haven't covered so far.

We've talked about:
* the formation of black holes from the core collapse of massive stars
* the structure of black holes
* tidal forces
* time dilation 
But there's still just a couple of things that I think would be interesting to talk about in this article, so if you've made it this far, well.... 1) thanks! and 2) just a touch more to go.





Black holes are truly what peak my curiosity for this universe, but I couldn't really tell you exactly why. Honestly, I find them absolutely terrifying - I mean imagine looking at one with your own eyes, knowing that what lies beyond that blackness, could literally be anything. But there's something about them that makes me feel as if they have more meaning in our universe than just forces of mass destruction, as if they're gateways to worlds beyond our own or something...

So black holes are extremely dense, 

Moving beyond the singularity, we have the bulk of a black hole. This is what forms most of a black hole's size, and, again, it's completely unknown what it exactly is, and there are some wild theories out there... Some people suggest it could merely be empty space, others a fiery hell. The fact is, nobody knows. Or at least nobody has come out and proven that they know - you could be the one to make history!

For centuries, physicists have been predicting the existence and mechanisms of, at the time, undiscovered objects, so you might be wondering why they don't simply go back to the drawing board on black holes.

The problem with that is they simply have no where to start... The density of black holes can't explained by the matter that we're aware of in the universe. 

Atomically speaking, under enough pressure, electrons can combine and neutralise with protons to form a body that's exclusively made from degenerate neutrons (Aka neutron stars - you can read more about them here), but neutrons obey an exclusion principal which, simply put, forbids them from occupying the same "place" in space.  

Therefore, under this current understanding, the most dense objects feasibly possible would be ones exclusively made from degenerate neutrons, as they would have the highest amount of mass per volume that's possible. Back holes, however, are somehow even denser. 

Something is either being misunderstood, or completely left out in the current models for our universe. 

Don't get me wrong, technology has come a very long way since Einstein predicted their existence, but we're very far from being able to even be remotely close to a black hole, and, as we'll talk about later, getting near close enough to one to be able to pull any kind of information, would be impossible with our current technology. 

Finally, at the very edge of black hole (trying not use the term surface...), we have the Event Horizon. Perhaps you've heard of this one before? I suppose it's the lining that separates what we know (or think we know at least), from what we don't know, and in that sense, it's the most "approachable" part of a black hole, not just physically, but mentally - what lies beyond it, is an absolute mystery. 

Light isn't quick enough

This is the point of no return, where beyond it, even light cannot travel fast enough to be able to escape the grasp of a black hole. For reference, light travels at 300,000,000 meters per second, or as I like to remember it, 186,000 miles per second. A single photon of light can circumnavigate the entire Earth at the equator 7.5 times in a single second. That is how fast light really is, yet not fast enough, which hopefully demonstrates to you just how strong of a gravitational field we are talking. 

The thing with black holes are that, while they might seem like terrors of this universe that ultimately destroy and consume other stars, as they roam around pulling everything in their vicinity with they're incredible gravitational fields, the reality is that they're partly responsible for the formation of galaxies. 
I say "partly" here, because, over the years, research has told us that black holes alone can't account for the formation and preservation of galaxies, and that there must be something else that's holding them together. That "glue" if you like, is what we now call dark matter, which you can read more about here if you're interested. 

At the centre of every galaxy, as well as our own, lies a black hole that pulls on every object in that galaxy. Our star (and hence our solar system), is orbiting around a huge, and I mean unimaginably massive, black hole that's placed in a whole separate category of black holes - a supermassive black hole (because it's far more massive than the average).

This black hole is called Sagittarius A* , and comes in at a colossal 4 million solar masses!

Yes - that means that this black hole is 4 million times "heavier" than the Sun. 
I wouldn't use the term "heavy" that often, simply because we're talking about mass here, and not weight, but for simplicity and sake of ease , you can think of it as so.

It's expected that there are millions of black holes roaming our galaxy, just freely moving throughout space, and, for the most part, minding their own business. 

Most black holes are incredibly small (small in volume), as they've not had the chance to consume much matter in the form of stars and even other black holes. Remember from earlier when I mentioned that you can think of a black hole as crushing the Earth down into a sugar cube? Well that's sort of the reality of it. Most black holes are stars that have been crushed down to fractions of the size, and don't have anything nearby to pull matter from. This is where the difference between size and mass is really important, as most black holes are tiny and massive at the same time, which is unusual for an object on Earth. 

As I mentioned earlier, it's extremely difficult to spot a black hole's existence, simply because the light is locked within it, beyond the Event Horizon. The light simply can't reach us, leaving an empty blackness in space, that blends in very well against a mostly black background. However, there is one way to spot a black hole. Their gravity is so strong, that light coming from behind it, from even more distant stars, nebulae and such, curves as it travels near the black hole - the black holes gravity bends the light around it, forming a disc of deformed light. 


If all of this has failed to fascinate you enough, then behold the most mind-boggling concept that has arisen from the existence of such gravitationally blessed objects...

Space-time curvature.

It's said that, by Einstein himself, and later proven by experiments made in the 20th and 21st Century, that gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of space due to mass, and since space and time exist in the same continuum, then it's a curvature of space-time. 

Gravity is due to an object's mass in space. Think of suspending a bowling ball on a trampoline. What you'll find is that the bowling ball's weight causes the fabric of the trampoline to bend, and if you were to place something lighter, say a marble, close enough, the curvature of the fabric would cause the marble to slide toward the bowling ball. This is the principal of Einstein's theory, but it should be known that this theory has been experimented  time and time again, and it's largely sound-proof. To my very limited knowledge on the matter, Einstein's equations are extremely robust, and if the idea of seeing where his theory of relativity comes from, with your own eyes, is interesting to you, then I'd recommend picking this book up off amazon (you can visit my "products" page for more info)

But this isn't the bomb-shell that I promised...

Notice I said "curvature of space-time", not just space. Einstein said that both space and time exist together as part of a Manifold, with time being a 4th dimension.  Hence, just as you can change your x, y and z vectors (moving back, forward, left, right, up and down), you can slo change your time vector, but with the limitation that you can only go forward, and never back. 

In principal, this means that curving space means curving time, and therefore time would be experienced relatively differently by users in different levels of curvature. The concept of this being relative is absolutely fundamental, and cannot be stressed enough.

You will feel time flowing exactly the same no matter where in the Universe you are, but from a different perspective (someone looking at you from a different place in the Universe), you might seem to be experiencing time differently. This concept is known as time dilation, and it's discussed in the same book that I mentioned earlier. 

This time difference is mostly unrecognisable here on Earth, or really anywhere other than a black hole, simply because the gravity, or the curvature is not large enough to produce a significant effect on time. Technically, if you were to stand up on a chair, you would age slower than you would on the floor. 

Why? 

Because you're further away from the Earth's centre of mass, and hence the space-time that you reside in is less curved. It's absolutely minimal, I'm talking far beyond nano-seconds, but this is because the Earth is so small , not compared to you and I, but as far as the universe is concerned, it's next to nothing. 

Now when we apply this to something like a supermassive black hole, what we find is perplexing. The incredibly large mass results in a curvature of space time that's unlike anything else. Now, as I mentioned, since no-one has been anywhere near a black hole, and creating one on earth is, at least for now, not possible, nobody could say for sure what effect the curvature of space has on the time that would be felt, but it's theorised that while hours could pass for us on Earth, years could pass for someone near a black hole. 

The largest black-hole that's been discovered so far, is called TON-618. This ultra-massive black hole is said to have a mass of 66,000,000,000 solar masses (yes, that's 66 billion)... 66 billion times the mass of our sun! Now, near something like that, perhaps time really could change as drastically as talked about so far, but it's still impossible to say.

Summary...

Black holes are among the greatest mysteries that man-kind has ever faced. Nobody knows what lies inside of them, and it's likely that we'll never know. Not unless we can come together as a species at least. When I was at school, there was no option to study astronomy, and I wonder how many children out there are being deprived of the opportunity to develop an interest in knowing their universe...

Is it true that black holes slowly disintegrate over time, Ryu?
