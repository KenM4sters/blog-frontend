Sonic booms were eventually banned in 1973, meaning that I, like a lot of people, haven't had the fortune (or misfortune?) of ever hearing one for myself.... 

So maybe you're here because you've seen them on YouTube and were fascinated to know how and why they happen, and if that's the case, then I can gladly tell you that you've come to the right place.

That or you're an avid Guile player on Street Fighter....

Anyway, it's an easy, short explanation, so without wasting any more time, let's jump into it!

Firstly, we can say that a sonic boom is produced when an object travels faster than the speed of sound, which is around 340m/s or 700mph (depending on air temperature and pressure), but why is that?

Let's talk about it. 


Sound Waves

I know I said that we weren't going to waste any more time, but if you're unsure of exactly what a sound wave is, then I'd highly recommend reading one of my other articles here, before continuing on with this one.

However, it's not completely necessary. 

Broadly, sound waves are what we describe as the motion of particles when they collide with each other. 

To help visualise this, think about the following:

Say you throw a pebble into a pond of water.

That pebble would displace a volume of water that's equal to its volume, which would cause the water molecules to bump into their adjacent molecules, creating this domino effect that we visualise as a wave. 

This wave would initially travel at x velocity, in all directions, and the size of the wave would depend on the momentum of the pebble that you threw in (ie how fast it was travelling, and how much it weighed: momentum = mass*velocity)

Well, it's a similar situation with sound waves, except these travel a heck of a lot quicker than the water waves we've just described.

Let's take a look at another situation though, which will better replicate the conditions for a sonic boom.

Imagine you're looking at a boat that's moving at some (relatively slow) velocity through a lake.

Because the boat is continuously moving, and producing water waves whenever it does so, these concentric water waves will end up radiating in the same as with the pebble example, except a slow moving boat will collide with the ones radiating ahead of the boat. 

The result of this?

Well, nothing really. The waves still appear as circles, and with the exception of the part that's in front of the boat that gets crushed, the waves radiate outward faster than the boat is moving. 

The interesting stuff happens when the boat begins to travel faster than the water waves....

In this case, the water waves produced can't radiate outward into concentric circles as they did before, simply because they can't move out of the way quick enough. 

As soon as they're produced, they're almost immediately crushed by the boat - they never get a chance to move out of the way and radiate outward into the circles as can be seen with a slow moving boat, or a pebble. 

The effect of this is that you end up with a line that's somewhere between being parallel and perpendicular to the boat, only the important thing to realise here is that this wave is essentially a combination of all the waves that couldn't get out of the way, and hence the size of this wave is comparatively much bigger. 

We call this line, or wave, the wake of a boat, and I'm sure you've all probably seen this in action, but here's a picture below to jog your memory!

Apologies that this isn't the best illustration out there, but I think it's clear enough to show how the circular waves are being crushed together to form almost straight lines that are at quite a sharp angle to the boat (beyond perpendicular, but not quite parallel) 





These waves are far more "intense", if you like, as they're essentially a combination of the smaller waves that would've propagated out had the boat been travelling slower than the water waves. 

To put this scientifically though, we can say that the amplitude of the waves that form a wake is much higher than the waves that formed the concentric circles. 

Don't worry, I've not forgotten that we're here to talk about the sonic boom of a jet/rocket.

The reason why I've gone through this whole comparison is because the situation is near enough identical, with the only real difference being that it's a sound wave instead of a water wave. 

Travelling faster than sound is a tough feat though - far tougher than travelling faster than water waves! 

To this date, you only ever hear of rockets and jets travelling faster than sound, the most famous example of which is probably the Concord, which went out of commission in 2003.

But just to elaborate on our situation with the sonic boom, we can say the following:

A sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. 

When this happens, the sound waves that are produced from the object colliding with the air particles, can't move out of the way quick enough, and hence they combine to form a sound wave that's of a much  higher amplitude ("loudness" or volume). 

Obviously I've already explained the reasoning behind this with the water example, and you can rest assured that they're exactly the same. 

Just like with the wake of a boat, sonic booms are only experienced when the object moves past you, and the amplitude dies down after it continues to move away, for reasons that I cover in the same article that I mentioned at the beginning - you can visit that one here.

The amplitude of a sonic boom is so high in fact, that it often caused windows to shatter! 

Probably one of the reasons that they were made illegal over residential neighbourhoods! (obviously a rocket is going to need to travel faster than sound to make it out of the atmosphere, so you can't ban them completely...)

With that said, that's about everything that you need to know.
