**Game Engine - C, OpenGL**

Creating a game engine in C has been both extremely challenging, and extremely rewarding at the same time. The project has been active for about 4 months now, during which time I’ve discovered not only so much about C and OpenGL, but what it takes to be a diligent, thorough software developer.  

As my first proper exposure to programming an application in C, technically, I found this to be very challenging, which has made the whole project all the more rewarding for me. From setting up makefiles, to rendering bullets and everything else in between, I’ve come out a completely different developer as to who I started as. 

When I think back to how I developed prior to this project, the contrast is stark - from properly understanding and utilising the benefits of good file structure, to makefiles, libraries, writing idiomatic, clear and concise code, writing comments appropriately, consistent naming conventions, and the list goes on… 

A more holistic review of the development of the game-engine can be found in the Github repository. 
While it’s really just a very basic game, it served as a fantastic introduction into not only graphics programming, but low-level programming in C. However, I’ve since moved on to creating an actual game engine in C++ which utilises the more relevant-to-today’s-technology API, Vulkan.
