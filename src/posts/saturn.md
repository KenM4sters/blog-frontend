title: Saturn - The Planet That Could Float On Water (Hypothetically)
description: Saturn is quite possibly the most widely known planet in the Solar System. I mean, if you asked someone to name a planet in the Solar System, then I think Saturn would definitely make the top 3 most popular choices, and with good reason.

The 2nd largest planet in our solar system, and arguably the most mysterious of them all, Saturn is the 6th planet from our star, the Sun. 

At its north pole lies a turbulent, hexagonal storm, 4 times the size of Earth, that has continued to puzzle astronomers for decades. 

It's comprised mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, but at its centre, where the gases are compressed to unimaginable scales, lies a core with temperatures breaking over 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hotter than the surface temperature of the Sun!

As you probably know, Saturn's most widely known for its rings, but the truth is that all the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) have rings, just Saturn's are considerably larger and more dense in ice, dust and rock. 

It's also the planet with the most moons, although more and more are being discovered everyday, totalling up to 83 so far. Jupiter comes in at a close 2nd with 80.
Disclaimer: Jupiter has since taken the top spot once again as 12 new moons have been confirmed as of March 2023, taking its total up to 92! 

Saturn can be seen with the naked eye very easily from Earth at the right time, and can be made out in detail fairly well through only a decent camera and lens or binoculars (obviously even better with a telescope though). 

But let's dive into the history of Saturn, as there are some extremely interesting ideas as to how the formation of Saturn potentially saved the Solar System...

A Super Earth

In the discovery of many solar systems beyond our own, something that's become quite apparent to us is that most solar systems have a "Super-Earth" that orbits very closely around their star. Think of a planet like Jupiter, 1300 times bigger than Earth, orbiting closer to its parent star than Mercury does to the Sun! 

It's said that this is a common sighting in our galaxy (most likely in others too), because as the gasses inside the nebula (I've covered more on the formation of stars and solar systems here) come together and fuse under the pressure due to gravity, they start to form larger, almost clumps of gases that now have a stronger gravitational field strength and pull in even more gas and dust. 

This pulling of gas and dust creates friction which in turn creates heat and is what starts this fireball that will later become a star. However, this can happen a few times within a nebula, and so you don't just and up with 1 star, but sometimes many. 

This is the reason for star clusters like the Pleiades , otherwise known as the Seven Sisters - a star cluster that's 444  light years from Earth, which you might be surprised to here is actually quite close, all things considering....

In the case of the nebula that formed the Sun, many protostars (small stars) could have also been born, but perhaps disassociated with each other over time, leaving only the Sun behind - nobody knows...

As the Sun became larger, its gravitational influence on the gas and dust also became larger, allowing it to pull more and more, all for itself.

However, some collected in time before being consumed by the Sun, and started to form the gas giants which were never able to make it into stars.


How Saturn saved the Solar System

I have actually written a separate article that covers this in more detail, so if what you're about to read interests you, then I'd recommend checking it out here! This is more of a brief overview. 

Among them, it's theorised that Jupiter was the first to be born and, as it thrived, the frictional forces with surrounding gases and rock gradually caused it's velocity around the Sun to slow down.

As a result, the planet began to spiral inwards, towards a one-way trip headed right for the Sun. 

As it made its way towards the Sun, in its path were all the gases, dust and rocks responsible for the formation for the 4 inner terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) - not looking good for us....

Thankfully, it started its journey but was never able to finish it - It never quite made it far enough to consume the matter that we believe was responsible for forming our very own planet (along with the others).

So why did Jupiter stop?

Because of Saturn. 

Saturn formed just at the right place, at the right time, and orbited around the Sun 3 times for every 2 times that Jupiter did. 

Because of this, Saturn came into close proximity with Jupiter for long enough to gradually tug it back over hundreds of millions of years with its strong gravitational field, away from the Sun. 

As they both drifted away to the positions that they're in today (Jupiter - 740 million km, Saturn - 1.4 billion km ), the matter that was left began to coalesce into the 4 inner planets. 

So, under this theory, which attempts to explain why there isn't a gas giant like Jupiter orbiting extremely closely around the Sun, Saturn saved us from essentially being consumed by Jupiter. 

But don't get too mad at Jupiter, as its gravitational influence is what frequently saves us from being bombarded with asteroids. Its powerful stance in this solar system causes asteroids that are flying by on a collision course with us to get slingshot away in different directions. 

Now that's an interesting story to tell at your next birthday party (or maybe not).

Moving on to the aesthetics of Saturn.... 


The origins of the famous ring system

You might be wondering where Saturn got its apparent rings from?
 
Well, it's important to note that they're just collections of mostly rock and ice, so nothing too crazy. Saturn just happened to be at the right place, at the right time (again...) to gain influence over such a large number of debris from the formation of the Sun. 

As I said earlier, all the other gas giants have them as well,  just they're relatively undetectable without huge telescopes. 

Composition

An interesting thing to know about Saturn, however, is in its composition. 

Saturn is almost exclusively comprised of hydrogen and helium, much like that of a star, which is near enough exactly the same as Jupiter. However, there is 1 remarkable difference between the two jovian planets....

Saturn is about 85% as large as Jupiter, but only 29% of its mass. Saturn's density is extremely low in comparison. In fact, to illustrate this, here's a data table of the densities (in g/cmÂ³) of the 8 planets in our solar system:

Terrestrial Planets

Mercury - 5.427

Venus - 5.204

Earth - 5.51

Mars - 3.94

Here, Mars is the only obvious outlier, but still comes in at over 78% of the average of the 4. 

Jovian Planets

Jupiter - 1.33

Saturn - 0.687

Uranus - 1.27

Neptune - 1.638

Saturn is a huge outlier here. It's a mere 56% of the average jovian planet's density. 

In relation to all the other jovian planets:

* Saturn has the same foundational composition (hydrogen and helium)
* It's not the hottest nor the coldest
* It doesn't spin the fastest nor the slowest
* It's not the closest nor the furthest from the Sun

So what makes it have such a low density? And I mean a density low enough that it could actually float on water... 

Yes, Saturn is less dense than water, meaning that it would float if you managed to have a pool of water large enough to fit it. The same cannot be said for the other planets.


Well, it's complicated.... and hypothetical, but here's the crux of it:

It all lies in the formation of the planets. 

As you might be aware, the reason why we have different states of matter in this world (solid, liquid and gas) is because of the different arrangements of particles. 

This arrangement is often determined by temperature, however it can also be altered by pressure. 

Both pressure and temperature change the way particles arrange themselves. 

**This is a really fundamental idea to get your head around, so I'd recommend checking out                   		   this article, as it's specific to that very concept. 

This is important because if you take the balls of hydrogen that the gas planets start off as (remember from earlier), you can see how the force of the hydrogen gas increases the pressure of the gases at the centre, which in turn transforms the gases into liquids and eventually solids. 

This is why all the gas planets have solid cores, which I know might seem counterintuitive as they're constantly referred to as "gas giants". This metallic hydrogen is extremely pressurised, which creates a lot of heat. 

As mentioned, Saturn's core is hotter than the surface of the Sun, but there comes a point where adding mass onto the planet doesn't change the volume that much because of the compression it causes on the inner gases. 

Imagine stacking pillows - eventually, at some point, adding a pillow won't change the volume that much, because you just shrink the pillows beneath it due to pressure. 

This explains why Saturn and Jupiter are similar in size, but where Jupiter's core is comprised almost all of this metallic hydrogen, Saturn's core is not, and is instead made from less dense material along with smaller proportions of metallic hydrogen. 

Essentially, Jupiter was able to consume more gas than Saturn, which allowed its core to become denser, while the planet remained roughly the same volume. 

This results in Jupiter's core weighing a lot more than Saturn's, which is what causes the overall density to be greater. 

Interestingly, this process of an increasing core density due to pulling in more gas is exactly what happens inside of a star - Jupiter had the potential to become a star, but it was never able to pull enough gas to increase it's core's density to the point where atoms would fuse and release immense amounts of energy (which is exactly what happens in a star.) 

Perhaps in a different universe we would have 2 stars, as oppose to 1... Although we probably wouldn't exist if that were the case!

I got very side-tracked but this is interesting none the less

The essence of producing a star is this very concept of stacking enough mass on a single point in space that results in enough pressure to physically fuse atoms together. 

Gases, like hydrogen, have to be placed under enormous amounts of pressure and temperature to fuse together, due to the fact that they will naturally avoid crashing into one another.

 I'm not going to get into the specifics of it here, but if you're familiar with Avogadro's number, then you'll know just how many hydrogen gas particles there would be in just 1cmÂ³ and all these gas particles are hurling around and high speeds, but slow enough to avoid contact with each other. 

However, when you increase the temperature or pressure of the system, the gas particles have too much kinetic energy, and therefore too much velocity to avoid each other, and consequently slam into each other causing their constituent nuclei to fuse together, which in turn releases vast quantities of energy. 

This process is know as nuclear fusion, and it drives the expansion of every single star - It's the fundamental process that allows a star to both form and survive. 

Without it, gravity would crush the star until it explodes in a catastrophic event known as a supernova, or if large enough, a hypernova. 

I know you might be trying to imagine the amount of energy released in this process, but it qualitatively it's inconceivable. 

As an example, there is a red-giant (large star) in our galaxy called Betelgeuse that is 642 light years away. 

That means that light (which travels at 300 million meters every second) would take 642 years to go from Betelgeuse to Earth (and visa-versa) - that is how far away we're talking. 

Even so, if Betelgeuse went supernova, the light would outshine everything in our sky (apart from the Sun).

In daytime, it would appear as though we have 2 Suns. 

Of course, it's also important to note that, as I mentioned before about it taking 642 years for light to reach us from Betelgeuse, it may have already happened. If Betelgeuse went supernova, we would only know about it 642 years later...  

By the way, Betelgeuse can easily be spotted in the night sky as it's very bright. If you live in the northern hemisphere,  just look for the 3 stars that are lined up closely to each other (they form the constellation of Orion), and Betelgeuse is the first star that you see directly above them. 

Anyway... I know that was a massive sidetrack from Saturn, but I feel as if just listing properties of Saturn is kind of mundane to both read and write.

Thanks for reading!
