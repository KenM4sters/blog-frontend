**Backend Web API - Rust (Actix Web), Docker, Postgresql**

This project was my first experience using backend frameworks/technologies, but I really wanted to avoid taking an easy route with lots of online tutorials/documentation - I wanted to challenge myself. 

At this point, I had little experience with Rust and was focussed on developing my game engine in C, however, upon discovering Rust, I immediately gelled to its intricacies and find it an absolute joy to work with, so I thought it would be a good time to develop my skillsets. 
It was also an ample opportunity to get to grips with working with databases, of which I chose Postgresql used in conjunction with Docker for this particular project.


After holistic research and trial runs with the various different backend frameworks for Rust, I opted for Actix Web after finding its ecosystem a bit more intuitive, and obviously being rated as one of the fastest frameworks around was fairly appealing. 

Overall, this was one of my favourite projects to date and working with Rust was as enjoyable as ever. Looking forward, developing in Rust is on the top of my priorities due to its viability in embedded software, graphics engines and full-stack web-app development.
