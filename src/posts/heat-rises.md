I'm sure you've all heard this one before, but what does it actually mean?

A clarification...

Well, let's start by clarifying that taken by itself, "heat rises" means absolutely nothing, and doesn't really make much sense at all!

Adding "heat" to an object essentially means giving it more kinetic energy, or in other words, increasing its temperature, since temperature is a measure of kinetic energy. 

From the beginning 

When particles have more kinetic energy, their translational velocities increase, which is just a fancy way of saying that they speed up, or "move about more". 

The effect of particles moving more is that they expand, and therefore their density decreases (density = mass/volume, hence increasing the volume will decrease the density). 
When I say that they "expand", I'm not saying that the atoms themselves expand, but rather the particles move further away from each other.

So let's say at this point, we've got a room full of air, which is mostly a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and we've applied some heat to some of these molecules. 

We're now wondering why the molecules that we applied the heat to are suddenly rising above their neighbouring molecules. 

Well, it's because of pressure, but let's take a look at the finer details so that we can fully understand why gases appear to rise when they heat up.

Density and pressure

The first concept to understand is that the density of air decreases with height from the surface. 

The reason for this is because the air molecules at the bottom essentially have the weight of all the molecules above them bearing down on them, which forces them to pack closer together, and hence increasing their density, as their cumulative mass is spread over a smaller area (remember that density = mass/volume).

As you increase in height from the surface, particles have less weight bearing down on them since there are less particles above them. 

In addition to this, the acceleration due to gravity that they feel towards the Earth's centre of mass also decreases with distance (which in this scenario is height from the surface), and hence they don't pack as tightly against the particles that are below them. 

Both of these factors lead to the density of air decreasing with height. 

Don't worry, we're still talking about why heat rises!

So let's say that, before any heat is applied, our packet of air sits somewhere in a room that's also full of air. 

The pressure below our air packet is greater than the pressure above, for reasons that I've just explained.

The effect of this is that because air particles are constantly colliding with each other with X amount of force per unit area, the net force on the bottom of our packet is greater than the force on the top, due to their being more particles below than above.

Therefore, our packet of air feels an overall force that's pushing it upwards. 

However, left at this, our packet of air would seemingly rise even without being heated, so we know that we're missing something!

That "something" is gravity....

Even though our packet of air feels an upward force due to the density being greater below than above, we've not yet accounted for the fact that gravity is constantly accelerating the air packet downwards, towards the Earth's centre of mass. 

Therefore, our packet of air doesn't rise.

Air particles will naturally find a position where they're in equilibrium, meaning that the gravitational "force" pulling them down is equal to the force pushing them up from the pressure of particles beneath them. 

However, if we apply heat to our packet of air, it will expand, and its density will decrease as we talked about earlier.

The consequence of this is that the volume of our packet of air has increased, meaning that its subject to the collision of more particles from below (because it covers a larger area).

Because we're talking about a packet of air that's within a room full of air (assuming they all contain equal amounts of the same mixture), the slightest increase in force due to pressure will produce a  net upwards force on our air molecules, causing them to rise. 

That's because less dense "things" will rise above more dense "things", because they feel more more of an acceleration upwards due to pressure, than downwards due to gravity.  

Our packet of air will continue to rise until it reaches a point where its density is the same as its neighbouring particles (remember that the density of air decreases with height from the surface).
